# Text-based Adventure Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game developed in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The game has been developed using Python 3.6+, so make sure you have a compatible version installed.

## Required Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the game:

- tkinter
- messagebox (part of tkinter)
- simpledialog (part of tkinter)
- random

`tkinter` is included in the standard Python library, so you don't need to install it separately. The other libraries are also part of the standard library and do not require additional installation steps.

## How to Play

Initially you need to write a name of your player into a terminal, when the game starts, you will see buttons for different rooms and options such as Inventory and Shop. Click on the buttons to interact with the game, fight enemies, collect items, and manage your inventory.
