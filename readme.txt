Text-based Adventure Game
This is a simple text-based adventure game developed in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

Required Libraries
The following libraries are required to run the game:

tkinter
messagebox (part of tkinter)
simpledialog (part of tkinter)
random
tkinter is included in the standard Python library, so you don't need to install it separately. The other libraries are also part of the standard library and do not require additional installation steps.

How to Play
Initially you need to write a name of your player into a terminal, when the game starts, you will see buttons for different rooms and options such as Inventory and Shop. Click on the buttons to interact with the game, fight enemies, collect items, and manage your inventory.

Enjoy the game!
